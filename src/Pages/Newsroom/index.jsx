        <h4 className="newsroom_text">Beach Volleyball summer camp 2010</h4>
        <p className="newsroom_small_text">
          Our club has a rich history of organizing successful Summer Coaching
          Beach Volleyball programs, which provide young athletes with the
          opportunity to develop their skills in beach volleyball. In 2010, we
          took our program to the next level by inviting two university coaches,
          Mark and Mitch from Florida, United States, to guide our young &
          potential athletes. The program was attended by over 30 athletes from
          all over Tamil Nadu, who were able to benefit from the expertise and
          guidance of the American coaches. The results were impressive, with
          our athletes showing significant improvement in their skills and
          abilities. We are proud to have provided such a valuable opportunity
          to our young athletes and to have contributed to the growth and
          development of beach volleyball in India. Stay tuned for more updates
          on our upcoming summer programs!
