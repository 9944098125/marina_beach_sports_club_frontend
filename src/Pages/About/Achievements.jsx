            We are proud to have organized several successful events in India,
            from 1993 till date including the FIVB 2008 & 2010 Beach Volleyball
            Tournament, which has become a major stop for the Asian Beach
            Volleyball Tour 2013. Our tournaments have drawn top talent from
            around the world and have helped to put Marina on the map as a
            premier destination for beach sports. Our club has a long history of
            organizing exciting and innovative events that showcase the best of
            beach sports. We have worked hard to build strong partnerships with
            local businesses, organizations, and government agencies to promote
            beach sports in India. Thanks to our team, the Marina Beach Sports
            Club has become a leading voice in the community for sports and
            fitness. Our events have not only helped to promote sports in the
            Marina area, but have also had a positive impact on the local
            economy. By drawing visitors from around the country and the world,
            we have helped to create jobs and stimulate economic growth in the
            area. We are constantly striving to improve and innovate our events
            to provide the best possible experience for our participants and
            spectators. Our commitment to excellence has earned us a reputation
            as one of the top sports clubs in the region, and we are proud to be
            a part of the Marina community.
